Your edge showed up clearly (multiple clean VWAP/Hulk shorts with continuation context), and you largely executed within your current tight risk constraints from the intraday trailing drawdown. The main behavioral risk is fear/pressure altering stop placement and readiness: you reported fear-based state and partial prep leading to protective stop adjustment and a small loss (T5). Key theme: discipline held despite emotional volatility—your focus and self-awareness prevented tilt, but the environment is compressing your holding time and increasing caution. Protect the process: maintain prep standards, and treat elevated arousal (heart rate/breathing) as a red flag that requires a short reset before the next entry.","user_reflection":"All in all, in terms of trying to build the buffer for the prop trading account, I think today was really positive. I traded professionally and I was really tight with my stop loss, I followed my plan. Despite the emotional roller coaster, I still executed well and I was very aware and conscious of not letting tilt come on or my emotions overtake me and then essentially losing control of what I was doing. This is what I have to focus on. I've just had so many days previously where I've had a good week of trading and then I've let my standards slip or perhaps just got too comfortable where I was at and ended up not following processes, not being as sharp as I should be in terms of my thinking and ended up on tilt and let my inner ego take over and basically just ruin all the hard work that I've done. I've made this mistake over and over and over again so it is paramount for me to really focus on the mental side, focus on building that strength, that composure, the willpower, changing my habits so that I'm constantly improving mentally. It's like high performance athletes and people that are at the top of their games, often isn't their skill base that's got them to where they are, it's their mental aspect and their fortitude there so I have to really, really, really, really push this otherwise there is no point in trading at the end of the day if I keep making these same mistakes. So to recap everything again, good trading overall, happy with performance because I was in this state, not because of winning but because I was in this state and looking to continue this and improve even further until I hit this buffer and then beyond and then I just want to keep this going for as long as I can and eventually be in a place where if I do have a day of tilt then it doesn't really matter because I have so much buffer and so much in my account that it's just a minor blip in an overall very, very solid trading performance."},{"review_id":"2026-01-14-EOD","date":"2026-01-14","type":"End of Day Review","net_pl":727.5,"win_rate":0.354,"avg_score":1.31,"cost_of_errors":-810,"ai_insight":"Made money but with low efficiency (1.31) and very high activity (48 trades), indicating overtrading/low selectivity.

Chose to stop for the day to reset. Intends to focus on basics next session: trade smaller (e.g., 1 contract), no stress, take only clear entries, and avoid the mindset of making it back. London session was traded poorly due to lack of prep and not dealing with losses, leading to trying to compensate in NY in a performance sense; wants to be more professional and handle losing properly."},{"review_id":"WR-2025-12-21","date":"2025-12-21","type":"End of Week Review","net_pl":1845,"win_rate":0.513,"avg_score":0.54,"cost_of_errors":-1085,"ai_insight":"Week 2025-12-15 to 2025-12-21: Net +1845.00 on 39 trades with 51.3% win rate, but Efficiency Score 0.54 (below 2.0 target) and Cost of Errors -1085.00 show a profitable week achieved with significant self-inflicted leakage. Notes show two modes: when executing well you are patient and let trades work; when impatience appears you force entries without signal, trade chop, and can slide into tilt (notably 2025-12-17: repeated ‘no signal/forced’ entries -> chasing -> breaking session rules -> trading until lockout/DD). Another recurring theme is inconsistency in protection/management when right (hesitation to move stop to BE) and P/L-protection psychology (fear of giving back profits leading to hesitation, then later forcing). Priority is eliminating ‘no-signal’ trades and having pre-decided management rules to prevent the impatience-to-tilt cascade.","user_reflection":"Although I had mistakes and moments of weakness / poor trading etc. I'm glad in the end that I was able to overcome them and end up net positive. So many times previous, I had let negative days affect me so badly that it would just get continually worse - eventually failing multiple challenges etc. Now I feel like I'm really focused on learning to 'lose' so to speak, making mistakes but remembering that they will happen and I just need to focus on being consistent and doing the right things, day in day out. Next week I want to continue this pattern and become even better than last week in terms of composure, execution etc."},{"review_id":"EOD-2025-12-18","date":"2025-12-18","type":"End of Day Review","net_pl":510,"win_rate":0.667,"avg_score":3.67,"cost_of_errors":0,"ai_insight":"Strong day in process and emotional control: repeated notes of calm, patience, and composure aligned with high efficiency (3.67) and zero cost of errors. You executed a consistent thesis (Asia low) and accepted when the flush didn’t materialize via disciplined BE management. Watch the one potential crack: resizing/adding because “risk wasn’t enough.” Ensure scaling rules are pre-defined rather than emotion-led. Keep using BE as a confirmation-based protection tool, not as discomfort avoidance.","user_reflection":"Thoughts for today follows much of what was said in the trade notes. Felt on point, felt composed and just ready to trade. Not overly emotional. I hope to keep the mind frame and composure for next session, and the session after that.

Notes indicate a pattern: missing an early trade triggers urgency/chasing, followed by repeated stop-outs; awareness of needing to walk away but continuing to trade; and revenge trading rationalized as “confluence.” Key risk is emotional escalation after a losing day leading to TILT and historically large drawdowns/account damage. Primary focus: protect mindset first—implement a mandatory reset protocol after missed trades or first significant emotional spike; prioritize selectivity and execution quality over participation.","user_reflection":"Yes definitely felt this. I have noticed that I can trade ok and be profitable for a few days, even weeks, however I am not trading effciently or inline with my strategy. Then I have a losing day, which typically sets me off and I end up on TILT. Often blowing my account. My goals for next week are to keep composed, keep consistent, focus on execution and being a 'professional trader' who understands the market isn't about winning, its about process, day in day out."}],"symbols":{"NQZ5":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1,"wins":0},"MGCJ6":{"pnl":-697,"trades":11,"wins":2},"NQH6":{"pnl":1215,"trades":12,"wins":7},"MNQH6":{"pnl":168.5,"trades":5,"wins":3}},"weekdays":{"Wednesday":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1},"Tuesday":{"pnl":686.5,"trades":28}},"hours":{"10":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1},"12":{"pnl":-591,"trades":12},"13":{"pnl":853,"trades":6},"14":{"pnl":60,"trades":5},"15":{"pnl":351.5,"trades":3},"16":{"pnl":13,"trades":2}},"equityTrades":[{"trade":1,"equity":49995.32,"date":"2025-12-10","pnl":-4.68},{"trade":2,"equity":49974.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-20.5},{"trade":3,"equity":49839.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-135},{"trade":4,"equity":49836.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-3.5},{"trade":5,"equity":49811.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-24.5},{"trade":6,"equity":49802.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-9.5},{"trade":7,"equity":49630.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-171.5},{"trade":8,"equity":49595.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-35},{"trade":9,"equity":49596.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":0.5},{"trade":10,"equity":49431.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-164.5},{"trade":11,"equity":49261.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-170},{"trade":12,"equity":49034.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-227.5},{"trade":13,"equity":49404.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":370},{"trade":14,"equity":49804.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":400},{"trade":15,"equity":50254.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":450},{"trade":16,"equity":50104.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-150},{"trade":17,"equity":50399.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":295},{"trade":18,"equity":50192.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-207},{"trade":19,"equity":50257.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":65},{"trade":20,"equity":50007.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-250},{"trade":21,"equity":50077.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":70},{"trade":22,"equity":49867.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-210},{"trade":23,"equity":50062.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":195},{"trade":24,"equity":50317.32,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":255},{"trade":25,"equity":50155.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-161.5},{"trade":26,"equity":50324.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":169},{"trade":27,"equity":50668.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":344},{"trade":28,"equity":50657.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":-11},{"trade":29,"equity":50681.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":24}],"equityDays":[{"day":0,"equity":50000,"date":"Start","pnl":0},{"day":1,"equity":49995.32,"date":"2025-12-10","pnl":-4.68},{"day":2,"equity":50681.82,"date":"2026-02-24","pnl":686.5}],"calendar":{"2025-11":{"10":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1}},"2026-1":{"24":{"pnl":686.5,"trades":28}}},"insights":[],"metadata":{"totalTrades":29,"netPL":681.8199999999999,"totalFees":101.68,"winRate":41.37931034482759,"winningTrades":12,"losingTrades":17,"breakEvenTrades":0,"profitFactor":1.3486357686329051,"avgWin":219.79166666666666,"avgLoss":115.04,"avgPL":23.511034482758618,"biggestWinner":450,"biggestLoser":-250,"maxDrawdown":965.6800000000003,"maxDrawdownPercent":1.9053775101209869,"currentBalance":50681.82,"startingBalance":50000,"returnPercent":1.36,"generatedAt":"2026-02-25T05:56:22.486Z","version":"1.2"}}
