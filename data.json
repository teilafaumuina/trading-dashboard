You executed a consistent thesis (Asia low) and accepted when the flush didn’t materialize via disciplined BE management. Watch the one potential crack: resizing/adding because “risk wasn’t enough.” Ensure scaling rules are pre-defined rather than emotion-led. Keep using BE as a confirmation-based protection tool, not as discomfort avoidance.","user_reflection":""},{"review_id":"WR-2025-50","date":"2025-12-16","type":"Weekly","net_pl":1967.5,"win_rate":0.457,"avg_score":0.52,"cost_of_errors":0,"ai_insight":"This week's journey highlighted various emotional challenges and opportunities for growth. There were frustrations due to missed trades and impulsive actions following early losses. Yet, there were valuable lessons in maintaining discipline, staying focused on your overarching motivations, and improving execution. Recognizing emotional trading patterns like FOMO and redirecting focus on strategic planning were key steps in this week's growth.","user_reflection":""},{"review_id":"WR-2025-50","date":"2025-12-14","type":"week","net_pl":1112.5,"win_rate":0.455,"avg_score":0.36,"cost_of_errors":0,"ai_insight":"You’re describing a very common cycle: 2–3 good weeks where discipline holds, then a sudden snap into TILT. That “snap” is rarely random—it’s usually preceded by small withdrawals from your discipline bank: forcing trades after a missed move, trying to fix a choppy session, or needing to end the day green. Last week you were more wary and that’s good—awareness is the early warning system. The next step is prevention: define your personal TILT trigger (missed first trade / early loss / chop), and have a hard circuit-breaker (pause, reduce size, or stop for the day) the moment the trigger appears. Your edge isn’t just entries—it’s staying composed when you feel the urge to regain control.","user_reflection":""},{"review_id":"W-2025-12-08_2025-12-14","date":"2025-12-14","type":"End of Week Review","net_pl":1112.5,"win_rate":0.455,"avg_score":0.36,"cost_of_errors":0,"ai_insight":"Net profitable week but very low efficiency (0.36 vs target >2.0), suggesting overtrading/chop exposure and entries not aligned with core strategy. Notes indicate a pattern: missing an early trade triggers urgency/chasing, followed by repeated stop-outs; awareness of needing to walk away but continuing to trade; and revenge trading rationalized as “confluence.” Key risk is emotional escalation after a losing day leading to TILT and historically large drawdowns/account damage. Primary focus: protect mindset first—implement a mandatory reset protocol after missed trades or first significant emotional spike; prioritize selectivity and execution quality over participation.","user_reflection":""},{"review_id":"WR-2023-11-50","date":"2023-11-10","type":"Weekly","net_pl":1967.5,"win_rate":0.457,"avg_score":0.52,"cost_of_errors":0,"ai_insight":"The week reflected both strengths and areas for growth.
