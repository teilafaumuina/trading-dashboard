I've made this mistake over and over and over again so it is paramount for me to really focus on the mental side, focus on building that strength, that composure, the willpower, changing my habits so that I'm constantly improving mentally. It's like high performance athletes and people that are at the top of their games, often isn't their skill base that's got them to where they are, it's their mental aspect and their fortitude there so I have to really, really, really, really push this otherwise there is no point in trading at the end of the day if I keep making these same mistakes. So to recap everything again, good trading overall, happy with performance because I was in this state, not because of winning but because I was in this state and looking to continue this and improve even further until I hit this buffer and then beyond and then I just want to keep this going for as long as I can and eventually be in a place where if I do have a day of tilt then it doesn't really matter because I have so much buffer and so much in my account that it's just a minor blip in an overall very, very solid trading performance."},{"review_id":"2026-01-14-EOD","date":"2026-01-14","type":"End of Day Review","net_pl":727.5,"win_rate":0.354,"avg_score":1.31,"cost_of_errors":-810,"ai_insight":"Made money but with low efficiency (1.31) and very high activity (48 trades), indicating overtrading/low selectivity.

I have noticed that I can trade ok and be profitable for a few days, even weeks, however I am not trading effciently or inline with my strategy. Then I have a losing day, which typically sets me off and I end up on TILT. Often blowing my account. My goals for next week are to keep composed, keep consistent, focus on execution and being a 'professional trader' who understands the market isn't about winning, its about process, day in day out."}],"symbols":{"NQZ5":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1,"wins":0},"NQH6":{"pnl":431.59999999999997,"trades":5,"wins":4},"MGCG6":{"pnl":217,"trades":6,"wins":4},"MNQH6":{"pnl":51.78,"trades":1,"wins":1}},"weekdays":{"Wednesday":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1},"Friday":{"pnl":431.59999999999997,"trades":5},"Monday":{"pnl":268.78,"trades":7}},"hours":{"9":{"pnl":498.48,"trades":6},"10":{"pnl":197.22,"trades":7}},"equityTrades":[{"trade":1,"equity":49995.32,"date":"2025-12-10","pnl":-4.68},{"trade":2,"equity":50215.64,"date":"2026-01-23","pnl":220.32},{"trade":3,"equity":50310.96,"date":"2026-01-23","pnl":95.32},{"trade":4,"equity":50356.28,"date":"2026-01-23","pnl":45.32},{"trade":5,"equity":50351.6,"date":"2026-01-23","pnl":-4.68},{"trade":6,"equity":50426.92,"date":"2026-01-23","pnl":75.32},{"trade":7,"equity":50235.8,"date":"2026-01-26","pnl":-191.12},{"trade":8,"equity":50299.64,"date":"2026-01-26","pnl":63.84},{"trade":9,"equity":50564.44,"date":"2026-01-26","pnl":264.8},{"trade":10,"equity":50452.28,"date":"2026-01-26","pnl":-112.16},{"trade":11,"equity":50504.08,"date":"2026-01-26","pnl":51.8},{"trade":12,"equity":50643.92,"date":"2026-01-26","pnl":139.84},{"trade":13,"equity":50695.7,"date":"2026-01-26","pnl":51.78}],"equityDays":[{"day":0,"equity":50000,"date":"Start","pnl":0},{"day":1,"equity":49995.32,"date":"2025-12-10","pnl":-4.68},{"day":2,"equity":50426.92,"date":"2026-01-23","pnl":431.59999999999997},{"day":3,"equity":50695.7,"date":"2026-01-26","pnl":268.78}],"calendar":{"2025-11":{"10":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1}},"2026-0":{"23":{"pnl":431.59999999999997,"trades":5},"26":{"pnl":268.78,"trades":7}}},"insights":["💪 Excellent profit factor - your edge is strong!"],"metadata":{"totalTrades":13,"netPL":695.7,"totalFees":84.3,"winRate":69.23076923076923,"winningTrades":9,"losingTrades":4,"breakEvenTrades":0,"profitFactor":3.2252430910951895,"avgWin":112.03777777777778,"avgLoss":78.16,"avgPL":53.51538461538462,"biggestWinner":264.8,"biggestLoser":-191.12,"maxDrawdown":191.11999999999534,"maxDrawdownPercent":0.3769944985472049,"currentBalance":50695.7,"startingBalance":50000,"returnPercent":1.39,"generatedAt":"2026-01-26T13:20:50.538Z","version":"1.2"}}
