(below 2.0 target) and Cost of Errors -1085.00 show a profitable week achieved with significant self-inflicted leakage. Notes show two modes: when executing well you are patient and let trades work; when impatience appears you force entries without signal, trade chop, and can slide into tilt (notably 2025-12-17: repeated ‘no signal/forced’ entries -> chasing -> breaking session rules -> trading until lockout/DD). Another recurring theme is inconsistency in protection/management when right (hesitation to move stop to BE) and P/L-protection psychology (fear of giving back profits leading to hesitation, then later forcing). Priority is eliminating ‘no-signal’ trades and having pre-decided management rules to prevent the impatience-to-tilt cascade.","user_reflection":"Although I had mistakes and moments of weakness / poor trading etc. I'm glad in the end that I was able to overcome them and end up net positive. So many times previous, I had let negative days affect me so badly that it would just get continually worse - eventually failing multiple challenges etc. Now I feel like I'm really focused on learning to 'lose' so to speak, making mistakes but remembering that they will happen and I just need to focus on being consistent and doing the right things, day in day out. Next week I want to continue this pattern and become even better than last week in terms of composure, execution etc."},{"review_id":"EOD-2025-12-18","date":"2025-12-18","type":"End of Day Review","net_pl":510,"win_rate":0.667,"avg_score":3.67,"cost_of_errors":0,"ai_insight":"Strong day in process and emotional control: repeated notes of calm, patience, and composure aligned with high efficiency (3.67) and zero cost of errors. You executed a consistent thesis (Asia low) and accepted when the flush didn’t materialize via disciplined BE management. Watch the one potential crack: resizing/adding because “risk wasn’t enough.” Ensure scaling rules are pre-defined rather than emotion-led. Keep using BE as a confirmation-based protection tool, not as discomfort avoidance.","user_reflection":"Thoughts for today follows much of what was said in the trade notes. Felt on point, felt composed and just ready to trade. Not overly emotional. I hope to keep the mind frame and composure for next session, and the session after that.

Notes indicate a pattern: missing an early trade triggers urgency/chasing, followed by repeated stop-outs; awareness of needing to walk away but continuing to trade; and revenge trading rationalized as “confluence.” Key risk is emotional escalation after a losing day leading to TILT and historically large drawdowns/account damage. Primary focus: protect mindset first—implement a mandatory reset protocol after missed trades or first significant emotional spike; prioritize selectivity and execution quality over participation.","user_reflection":"Yes definitely felt this. I have noticed that I can trade ok and be profitable for a few days, even weeks, however I am not trading effciently or inline with my strategy. Then I have a losing day, which typically sets me off and I end up on TILT. Often blowing my account. My goals for next week are to keep composed, keep consistent, focus on execution and being a 'professional trader' who understands the market isn't about winning, its about process, day in day out."}],"symbols":{"NQZ5":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1,"wins":0},"ESH6":{"pnl":815.64,"trades":1,"wins":1},"NQH6":{"pnl":-328.3999999999999,"trades":5,"wins":2},"GCG6":{"pnl":-655.06,"trades":3,"wins":0}},"weekdays":{"Wednesday":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1},"Friday":{"pnl":-167.82,"trades":9}},"hours":{"10":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1},"15":{"pnl":151.88,"trades":7},"16":{"pnl":-319.7,"trades":2}},"equityTrades":[{"trade":1,"equity":49995.32,"date":"2025-12-10","pnl":-4.68},{"trade":2,"equity":50810.96,"date":"2025-12-26","pnl":815.64},{"trade":3,"equity":50456.28,"date":"2025-12-26","pnl":-354.68},{"trade":4,"equity":50231.6,"date":"2025-12-26","pnl":-224.68},{"trade":5,"equity":50226.58,"date":"2025-12-26","pnl":-5.02},{"trade":6,"equity":49731.9,"date":"2025-12-26","pnl":-494.68},{"trade":7,"equity":50472.22,"date":"2025-12-26","pnl":740.32},{"trade":8,"equity":50147.2,"date":"2025-12-26","pnl":-325.02},{"trade":9,"equity":49822.18,"date":"2025-12-26","pnl":-325.02},{"trade":10,"equity":49827.5,"date":"2025-12-26","pnl":5.32}],"equityDays":[{"day":0,"equity":50000,"date":"Start","pnl":0},{"day":1,"equity":49995.32,"date":"2025-12-10","pnl":-4.68},{"day":2,"equity":49827.5,"date":"2025-12-26","pnl":-167.82}],"calendar":{"2025-11":{"10":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1},"26":{"pnl":-167.82,"trades":9}}},"insights":["⚠️ Win rate below 40% - review entry criteria."],"metadata":{"totalTrades":10,"netPL":-172.49999999999994,"totalFees":52.49999999999999,"winRate":30,"winningTrades":3,"losingTrades":7,"breakEvenTrades":0,"profitFactor":0.9005064079641015,"avgWin":520.4266666666666,"avgLoss":247.68285714285713,"avgPL":-17.249999999999993,"biggestWinner":815.64,"biggestLoser":-494.68,"maxDrawdown":1079.0599999999977,"maxDrawdownPercent":2.123675679420341,"currentBalance":49827.5,"startingBalance":50000,"returnPercent":-0.34,"generatedAt":"2025-12-26T17:05:53.748Z","version":"1.2"}}
