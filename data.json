Main pattern: profitability is being capped by low efficiency (early exits / not holding to targets) and a recurring emotional chain reaction after feeling 'cheated' or missing profit (early exit/stop -> frustration -> make-up mindset -> forced trades/revenge). Notes also indicate environmental stress/noise contributed to premature exits. When composed, execution aligns with a clear model (momentum/context + structured entry/add + thesis to level). Key focus: interrupt the revenge loop immediately after a perceived injustice and protect the account from tilt-induced drawdown.\n\nActionable rule: mandatory flat break (e.g., 10 minutes) after any non-model trade, early exit, or 2 losses in a row; reduce size when environment is distracting.","user_reflection":"Up-and-down week with a notable tilt episode on Mon 2025-12-29 leading to significant drawdown (would have been near max daily drawdown on a challenge). Regained composure and traded well afterward. Recognizes ability to make money but must be careful after a couple losses or when feeling missed out/cheated.

Behavioral patterns: (1) Edge shows when you pick best market/setup and execute cleanly (T2 template). (2) Biggest leak was not entries but risk and interference: exposure stacking (ES+NQ) and repeated over-risking (notably T8/T9) led to stop tinkering and trading P/L rather than the trade. (3) Emotional sequencing: after a win or stop-out you pressed (greed/forcing/overconfidence in T4), turning an otherwise fine day into error-cost. Key rule: if you feel over-risked, reduce size or do not trade; over-size reliably triggers micromanagement and collapses edge.","user_reflection":"Noted that early-session greed and subsequent mistakes need to be sat with rather than “pushed for more.” Recognized a repeating pattern over recent sessions: make mistakes/go into drawdown, then over-risk and try to trade out of drawdown instead of stopping to reset and review plan, execution, and composure. Chose to stop for the day to reset. Intends to focus on basics next session: trade smaller (e.g., 1 contract), no stress, take only clear entries, and avoid the mindset of making it back. London session was traded poorly due to lack of prep and not dealing with losses, leading to trying to compensate in NY in a performance sense; wants to be more professional and handle losing properly."},{"review_id":"WR-2025-12-21","date":"2025-12-21","type":"End of Week Review","net_pl":1845,"win_rate":0.513,"avg_score":0.54,"cost_of_errors":-1085,"ai_insight":"Week 2025-12-15 to 2025-12-21: Net +1845.00 on 39 trades with 51.3% win rate, but Efficiency Score 0.54 (below 2.0 target) and Cost of Errors -1085.00 show a profitable week achieved with significant self-inflicted leakage. Notes show two modes: when executing well you are patient and let trades work; when impatience appears you force entries without signal, trade chop, and can slide into tilt (notably 2025-12-17: repeated ‘no signal/forced’ entries -> chasing -> breaking session rules -> trading until lockout/DD). Another recurring theme is inconsistency in protection/management when right (hesitation to move stop to BE) and P/L-protection psychology (fear of giving back profits leading to hesitation, then later forcing). Priority is eliminating ‘no-signal’ trades and having pre-decided management rules to prevent the impatience-to-tilt cascade.","user_reflection":"Although I had mistakes and moments of weakness / poor trading etc. I'm glad in the end that I was able to overcome them and end up net positive. So many times previous, I had let negative days affect me so badly that it would just get continually worse - eventually failing multiple challenges etc. Now I feel like I'm really focused on learning to 'lose' so to speak, making mistakes but remembering that they will happen and I just need to focus on being consistent and doing the right things, day in day out.

You executed a consistent thesis (Asia low) and accepted when the flush didn’t materialize via disciplined BE management.

Keep using BE as a confirmation-based protection tool, not as discomfort avoidance.","user_reflection":"Thoughts for today follows much of what was said in the trade notes.

Primary focus: protect mindset first—implement a mandatory reset protocol after missed trades or first significant emotional spike; prioritize selectivity and execution quality over participation.","user_reflection":"Yes definitely felt this. I have noticed that I can trade ok and be profitable for a few days, even weeks, however I am not trading effciently or inline with my strategy.
