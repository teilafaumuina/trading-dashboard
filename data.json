Best skill demonstrated: in T12 you felt nervous yet did not interfere—execution over emotion.","user_reflection":"Felt positive, locked in, composed and focused.

Your edge showed up clearly (multiple clean VWAP/Hulk shorts with continuation context), and you largely executed within your current tight risk constraints from the intraday trailing drawdown. The main behavioral risk is fear/pressure altering stop placement and readiness: you reported fear-based state and partial prep leading to protective stop adjustment and a small loss (T5). Key theme: discipline held despite emotional volatility—your focus and self-awareness prevented tilt, but the environment is compressing your holding time and increasing caution. Protect the process: maintain prep standards, and treat elevated arousal (heart rate/breathing) as a red flag that requires a short reset before the next entry.","user_reflection":"All in all, in terms of trying to build the buffer for the prop trading account, I think today was really positive. I traded professionally and I was really tight with my stop loss, I followed my plan. Despite the emotional roller coaster, I still executed well and I was very aware and conscious of not letting tilt come on or my emotions overtake me and then essentially losing control of what I was doing. This is what I have to focus on. I've just had so many days previously where I've had a good week of trading and then I've let my standards slip or perhaps just got too comfortable where I was at and ended up not following processes, not being as sharp as I should be in terms of my thinking and ended up on tilt and let my inner ego take over and basically just ruin all the hard work that I've done. I've made this mistake over and over and over again so it is paramount for me to really focus on the mental side, focus on building that strength, that composure, the willpower, changing my habits so that I'm constantly improving mentally. It's like high performance athletes and people that are at the top of their games, often isn't their skill base that's got them to where they are, it's their mental aspect and their fortitude there so I have to really, really, really, really push this otherwise there is no point in trading at the end of the day if I keep making these same mistakes. So to recap everything again, good trading overall, happy with performance because I was in this state, not because of winning but because I was in this state and looking to continue this and improve even further until I hit this buffer and then beyond and then I just want to keep this going for as long as I can and eventually be in a place where if I do have a day of tilt then it doesn't really matter because I have so much buffer and so much in my account that it's just a minor blip in an overall very, very solid trading performance."},{"review_id":"2026-01-14-EOD","date":"2026-01-14","type":"End of Day Review","net_pl":727.5,"win_rate":0.354,"avg_score":1.31,"cost_of_errors":-810,"ai_insight":"Made money but with low efficiency (1.31) and very high activity (48 trades), indicating overtrading/low selectivity.

Another recurring theme is inconsistency in protection/management when right (hesitation to move stop to BE) and P/L-protection psychology (fear of giving back profits leading to hesitation, then later forcing).
