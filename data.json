Notes show two modes: when executing well you are patient and let trades work; when impatience appears you force entries without signal, trade chop, and can slide into tilt (notably 2025-12-17: repeated ‘no signal/forced’ entries -> chasing -> breaking session rules -> trading until lockout/DD). Another recurring theme is inconsistency in protection/management when right (hesitation to move stop to BE) and P/L-protection psychology (fear of giving back profits leading to hesitation, then later forcing). Priority is eliminating ‘no-signal’ trades and having pre-decided management rules to prevent the impatience-to-tilt cascade.","user_reflection":"Although I had mistakes and moments of weakness / poor trading etc. I'm glad in the end that I was able to overcome them and end up net positive. So many times previous, I had let negative days affect me so badly that it would just get continually worse - eventually failing multiple challenges etc. Now I feel like I'm really focused on learning to 'lose' so to speak, making mistakes but remembering that they will happen and I just need to focus on being consistent and doing the right things, day in day out. Next week I want to continue this pattern and become even better than last week in terms of composure, execution etc."},{"review_id":"EOD-2025-12-18","date":"2025-12-18","type":"End of Day Review","net_pl":510,"win_rate":0.667,"avg_score":3.67,"cost_of_errors":0,"ai_insight":"Strong day in process and emotional control: repeated notes of calm, patience, and composure aligned with high efficiency (3.67) and zero cost of errors. You executed a consistent thesis (Asia low) and accepted when the flush didn’t materialize via disciplined BE management. Watch the one potential crack: resizing/adding because “risk wasn’t enough.” Ensure scaling rules are pre-defined rather than emotion-led. Keep using BE as a confirmation-based protection tool, not as discomfort avoidance.","user_reflection":"Thoughts for today follows much of what was said in the trade notes. Felt on point, felt composed and just ready to trade. Not overly emotional. I hope to keep the mind frame and composure for next session, and the session after that. Eventually let it be my baseline and really start getting consistent with my trading."},{"review_id":"W-2025-12-08_2025-12-14","date":"2025-12-14","type":"End of Week Review","net_pl":1112.5,"win_rate":0.455,"avg_score":0.36,"cost_of_errors":0,"ai_insight":"Net profitable week but very low efficiency (0.36 vs target >2.0), suggesting overtrading/chop exposure and entries not aligned with core strategy. Notes indicate a pattern: missing an early trade triggers urgency/chasing, followed by repeated stop-outs; awareness of needing to walk away but continuing to trade; and revenge trading rationalized as “confluence.” Key risk is emotional escalation after a losing day leading to TILT and historically large drawdowns/account damage. Primary focus: protect mindset first—implement a mandatory reset protocol after missed trades or first significant emotional spike; prioritize selectivity and execution quality over participation.","user_reflection":"Yes definitely felt this. I have noticed that I can trade ok and be profitable for a few days, even weeks, however I am not trading effciently or inline with my strategy. Then I have a losing day, which typically sets me off and I end up on TILT. Often blowing my account. My goals for next week are to keep composed, keep consistent, focus on execution and being a 'professional trader' who understands the market isn't about winning, its about process, day in day out."}],"symbols":{"NQZ5":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1,"wins":0},"GCG6":{"pnl":1444.2600000000007,"trades":36,"wins":16},"NQH6":{"pnl":150.75999999999993,"trades":18,"wins":7},"ESH6":{"pnl":-34.36,"trades":1,"wins":0}},"weekdays":{"Wednesday":{"pnl":-204.09999999999957,"trades":43},"Friday":{"pnl":579.8000000000001,"trades":10},"Monday":{"pnl":600.32,"trades":1},"Tuesday":{"pnl":579.96,"trades":2}},"hours":{"9":{"pnl":706.7600000000001,"trades":14},"10":{"pnl":-242.52000000000007,"trades":12},"11":{"pnl":-143.98000000000005,"trades":15},"12":{"pnl":295.1200000000002,"trades":11},"13":{"pnl":940.6,"trades":4}},"equityTrades":[{"trade":1,"equity":49995.32,"date":"2025-12-10","pnl":-4.68},{"trade":2,"equity":49940.3,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":-55.019999999999996},{"trade":3,"equity":49845.28,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":-95.02},{"trade":4,"equity":49760.26,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":-85.02},{"trade":5,"equity":49625.24,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":-135.02},{"trade":6,"equity":49570.22,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":-55.019999999999996},{"trade":7,"equity":49435.2,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":-135.02},{"trade":8,"equity":49730.18,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":294.98},{"trade":9,"equity":49855.16,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":124.98},{"trade":10,"equity":49920.14,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":64.98},{"trade":11,"equity":50575.12,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":654.98},{"trade":12,"equity":51175.44,"date":"2026-01-12","pnl":600.32},{"trade":13,"equity":51630.42,"date":"2026-01-13","pnl":454.98},{"trade":14,"equity":51755.4,"date":"2026-01-13","pnl":124.98},{"trade":15,"equity":51560.72,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-194.68},{"trade":16,"equity":51425.7,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-135.02},{"trade":17,"equity":51246.02,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-179.68},{"trade":18,"equity":51051,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-195.02},{"trade":19,"equity":50891.32,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-159.68},{"trade":20,"equity":50736.3,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-155.02},{"trade":21,"equity":50631.62,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-104.68},{"trade":22,"equity":50516.94,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-114.68},{"trade":23,"equity":50551.92,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":34.980000000000004},{"trade":24,"equity":50966.9,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":414.98},{"trade":25,"equity":51281.88,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":314.98},{"trade":26,"equity":51227.2,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-54.68},{"trade":27,"equity":51137.52,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-89.68},{"trade":28,"equity":51087.84,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-49.68},{"trade":29,"equity":51062.82,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-25.02},{"trade":30,"equity":51057.8,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-5.02},{"trade":31,"equity":51022.78,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-35.019999999999996},{"trade":32,"equity":51037.76,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":14.98},{"trade":33,"equity":51043.08,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":5.32},{"trade":34,"equity":51038.4,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-4.68},{"trade":35,"equity":51058.72,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":20.32},{"trade":36,"equity":51044.04,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-14.68},{"trade":37,"equity":51009.68,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-34.36},{"trade":38,"equity":51280,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":270.32},{"trade":39,"equity":51525.32,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":245.32},{"trade":40,"equity":51215.28,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-310.04},{"trade":41,"equity":51220.26,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":4.98},{"trade":42,"equity":51205.24,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-15.02},{"trade":43,"equity":51140.22,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-65.02},{"trade":44,"equity":51165.2,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":24.98},{"trade":45,"equity":51020.18,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-145.02},{"trade":46,"equity":50925.159999999996,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-95.02},{"trade":47,"equity":50760.14,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-165.02},{"trade":48,"equity":50755.12,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-5.02},{"trade":49,"equity":50760.1,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":4.98},{"trade":50,"equity":50745.08,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-15.02},{"trade":51,"equity":50750.06,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":4.98},{"trade":52,"equity":50615.38,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-134.68},{"trade":53,"equity":51090.36,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":474.98},{"trade":54,"equity":51445.34,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":354.98},{"trade":55,"equity":51555.659999999996,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":110.32},{"trade":56,"equity":51555.979999999996,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":0.3200000000000003}],"equityDays":[{"day":0,"equity":50000,"date":"Start","pnl":0},{"day":1,"equity":49995.32,"date":"2025-12-10","pnl":-4.68},{"day":2,"equity":50575.12,"date":"2026-01-09","pnl":579.8000000000001},{"day":3,"equity":51175.44,"date":"2026-01-12","pnl":600.32},{"day":4,"equity":51755.4,"date":"2026-01-13","pnl":579.96},{"day":5,"equity":51555.98,"date":"2026-01-14","pnl":-199.41999999999973}],"calendar":{"2025-11":{"10":{"pnl":-4.68,"trades":1}},"2026-0":{"9":{"pnl":579.8000000000001,"trades":10},"12":{"pnl":600.32,"trades":1},"13":{"pnl":579.96,"trades":2},"14":{"pnl":-199.41999999999973,"trades":42}}},"insights":[],"metadata":{"totalTrades":56,"netPL":1555.9799999999996,"totalFees":284.0200000000001,"winRate":41.0714
