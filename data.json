(3) Emotional sequencing: after a win or stop-out you pressed (greed/forcing/overconfidence in T4), turning an otherwise fine day into error-cost.

Chose to stop for the day to reset. Intends to focus on basics next session: trade smaller (e.g., 1 contract), no stress, take only clear entries, and avoid the mindset of making it back.

Notes show two modes: when executing well you are patient and let trades work; when impatience appears you force entries without signal, trade chop, and can slide into tilt (notably 2025-12-17: repeated ‘no signal/forced’ entries -> chasing -> breaking session rules -> trading until lockout/DD). Another recurring theme is inconsistency in protection/management when right (hesitation to move stop to BE) and P/L-protection psychology (fear of giving back profits leading to hesitation, then later forcing). Priority is eliminating ‘no-signal’ trades and having pre-decided management rules to prevent the impatience-to-tilt cascade.","user_reflection":"Although I had mistakes and moments of weakness / poor trading etc. I'm glad in the end that I was able to overcome them and end up net positive.
