of strong reaction to 5m GAP. Large bearish candles added confluence to go short. No HULK signal; entry candle formation had no wick in direction of trade (momentum still bearish). Happy with execution. Emotions were fear-based: didn’t want to lose profit from earlier trade. Felt I exited too early initially, but on review it was the right decision because it wasn’t an A+ entry signal, so needed to manage tightly and protect account/position. Compared to a later setup I didn’t take after hitting daily TP: clean HULK candle, where SL management would have been more accommodating to let trade run to full TP.","screenshot":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KKt32w67ZgB-W_6VYneoBF5Bx87cgFzg/view?usp=drivesdk","pre_trade":"Complete Prep","trade_entry":"Minor Deviation","trade_management":"Followed Plan","trade_exit":"Followed Plan","screenshot_url_A":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KKt32w67ZgB-W_6VYneoBF5Bx87cgFzg/view?usp=drivesdk","clean_gross_pnl":330,"clean_fees":5.02,"clean_net_profit":324.98},{"row_number":12,"trade_id":"T11","date":"2025-12-29","symbol":"MGCG6","side":"Long","contracts":6,"entry_time":"9:13:33","entry_price":4501.4,"stop_price":"","target_price":"","exit_time":"9:25:01","exit_price":4505,"fees":12.24,"p_l_net":203.76,"p_l":216,"setup":"","session":"","score":2,"notes":"Almost A+ entry shown on GC.
